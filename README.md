Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

The best place to fit automated tests is within a GitHub Action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is so we ensure continuous and consistent feedback, allowing developers to catch and fix issues early in the development process. It also enforces code quality standards across all contributors by automatically running tests in a clean, controlled environment, unlike manually running tests locally—which can be forgotten or affected by differences in local setups—and running tests only after development is complete—which risks discovering bugs too late—integrating tests into a GitHub Action supports a more reliable and efficient workflow. This practice aligns with modern continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) strategies and safer code delivery.
